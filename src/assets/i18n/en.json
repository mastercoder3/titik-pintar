  "FEATURED TEXT":"Every 5 years the people of Indonesia can vote on who they believe should lead the country. Everyone is different. What you think is important might not be the same as what your friends think is important. That is why you can choose a president and a party that matches what you think and feel. All Indonesian people get one vote and the person with the most votes is the winner!",
